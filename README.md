# 👋 Welcome to my GitHub!

## Who am I?

Hi there! I’m a **23-year-old developer** from France, diving deep into the world of **smart contract development**. My journey into blockchain is unconventional—I started as an **Industrial Engineer**, but my passion for **Web3**, **security**, and **mathematics** brought me into this exciting and fast-evolving space.

## My Goal 🚀

My ultimate goal is to become one of the **top smart contract auditors** and a leading **DeFi Security Researcher**. I am driven by the challenge of understanding intricate systems, identifying vulnerabilities, and contributing to a safer blockchain ecosystem.

### What I’m passionate about:
- 🔒 **Smart Contract Security**: Discovering, analyzing, and preventing vulnerabilities.
- 🧮 **Mathematics**: Applying analytical rigor to solve complex technical problems.
- 🌐 **Web3 Development**: Building secure, efficient decentralized applications (dApps).
- 🌟 **Public Smart Contract Reviews**: Collaborating with the community to analyze, review, and improve smart contracts.

## What I’m working on 🛠️

I’m currently focusing on **DeFi projects** and honing my expertise in smart contract auditing. My ongoing efforts include:
- 📜 Developing **decentralized financial protocols** (e.g., AMMs, lending platforms).
- 🔍 Conducting **public smart contract reviews** to enhance my auditing skills and contribute to the community.
- 🔬 Exploring and mitigating security threats like reentrancy, flash loan attacks, and other DeFi exploits.
- 📊 Writing **technical blog posts** to document vulnerabilities and share best practices in smart contract development.

Technologies I use:
- **Solidity** & **Foundry** for smart contract development and testing.
- **Rust** for performance-critical projects.
- **Visualization tools** like **Excalidraw** and **Matplotlib** for explaining complex concepts.

## Why Security? 🤔

I firmly believe that **security** is the backbone of Web3. In an industry where billions of dollars are at risk, even a single line of code can make the difference between trust and catastrophe. My mission is to master the art of **smart contract auditing** and become a trusted name in securing protocols and protecting user assets.
